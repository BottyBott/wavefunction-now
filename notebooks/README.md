# Notebooks Roadmap

These notebooks will illustrate how discrete detector events build up empirical
correlations that match \(|\psi|^2\) predictions.

Planned notebooks:

1. `free_wavepacket.ipynb`
   - Simulate Gaussian packet propagation.
   - Plot probability density vs Monte Carlo samples to show agreement.

2. `double_slit_events.ipynb`
   - Generate interference pattern one event at a time.
   - Accumulate histogram of hits and compare to theoretical \(|\psi|^2\).

3. `stern_gerlach_correlations.ipynb`
   - Model two-stage Sternâ€“Gerlach setup.
   - Show correlation of spin-up/spin-down outcomes vs theoretical prediction.

Each notebook emphasises: detectors record binary events; the wave function is
the blueprint that predicts the spatial-temporal correlation structure.
